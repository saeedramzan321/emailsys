
I have Used Client-Side Languages such as HTML,CCS,JAVASCRIPT

Bootstrap CSS frame work is also used to design front-end of the application. This frame supports for
mobile responsive also.

Ajax jqeury is also used to retrieve and send data from a server asynchronously without interfering
with the display and behavior of the existing page

There are three files are used to design this application, such as index.html,script.js and design.css

you can check the application by clicking index.html file.  

# Process of completing the missions

First I have designed the mock up design using html, such as date picker, search button and search text field, I have placed every component in correct position using CSS and added suitable colour and
icons.

Then I have created sample data using JSON object and created 5 data fields, such as
Id,email,to,subject and date. Then I have created a function called DisplayResult(), which do two main roles, such as specify data according to specific date range and create the table.
In Addition, useful comments are also mentioned in the coding section for further clarification.


Note:
I have stored data from the beginning of 2020(January) to the end of 2020(october), So Data can be successfully searched within this period.

Default date is set from - 01-01-2020 to 06-10-2020 in the application.
